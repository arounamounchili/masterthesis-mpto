Welcome to MPTO's documentation!
===================================

**MPTO** or Multiphase topological optimization is a simulation technique 
based on the principle of the finite element method that allows to determine
the optimal distribution of two or more different materials in combination 
under thermal and mechanical loads.

Master's thesis on the optimization of material distributions in mechanically
loaded multi-material components using simulated annealing and evolutionary algorithms.

how to :ref:`installation` the project.
